# Solar-Panel-Cleaning-System
Project Overview:
This project focuses on creating an automated cleaning system for solar panels. It detects dirt accumulation using light intensity sensors (LDRs) and activates a servo motor-controlled wiper mechanism to maintain the panel's efficiency. The system is cost-effective, scalable, and minimizes the need for manual cleaning.

Features:
Detects dirt on solar panels by comparing light intensity readings from clean and dirty surfaces.
Activates a wiper mechanism when cleaning is needed.
Logs system activity in the Arduino Serial Monitor.
Hardware Components:
Arduino Uno
Light Intensity Sensors (LDRs)
Micro Servo Motor
Solar Panel (test surface)
Resistors, Breadboard, Jumper Wires
Power Supply
Software Requirements:
Arduino IDE
System Workflow:
Initialization: Sensors and servo motor are set up.
Data Collection: Light intensity values are read from clean and dirty surfaces.
Comparison: The system checks if the intensity difference exceeds the threshold.
Cleaning Process: The servo motor activates the wiper mechanism to clean the panel.
Recheck: Sensors confirm cleanliness after the cleaning process.
Future Scope:
Adding water spraying mechanisms.
Using solar-powered batteries for self-sustainability.
Enabling IoT-based monitoring and control.
